    <p class="para">We hesitate to act because we're fearful of doing something wrong. Or we fear that our actions will deliver poor results.
      And importantly, it deosn't matter whether our presumed failure and many of us will go to great lengths to avoid them.</p>
    <p class="para">This fearfulness can stem from a number of things. For example, lack of familiarity with a given task or process may cause us to hesitate.
    The unfamiliarity makes the outcome of our actions more uncertain, which exacerbates our fear of failure. We end up deliberating whether it's
    necessary to act immediately or if the task in question can be delayed. </p>
    <p class="para">Our fear of failure may also be prompted by a past experience that was embarrassing or traumatic in some way. For instance, suppose you once bombed while speaking in front of a large audience.
      The experience was embarrassing enough for you, so much that it has become ingrained in your memory. Unless you've since participated in successful speaking engagements that mitigated the feelings behind
      that earleir traumatic, you might be disinclined to speak in front of an audience again. At the very least, you'd look for ways to delay doing so.</p>
